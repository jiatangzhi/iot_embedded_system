# IoT Embedded System
The aim of this IoT project was to create a remote temperature and humidity sensor with the capability of providing real-time data of its sensor readings.
The sensor readings would be accessible via the internet on a webpage with added functionality such as current sensor readings, past maximum, and past minimum readings. This was done by creating an IoT device using a `Raspberry Pi Pico`, a `DHT11 sensor`, and an `SD card reader`. Once the DHT11 sensor and SD card reader were connected to the Pico, the Pico was connected to a laptop. Using `Thonny`, a Python script was created and loaded onto the Pico to generate the temperature and humidity readings, save the sensor data as a JSON file on the SDcard, and send the sensor readings to pythonanywhere via the internet. The incoming sensor data in pythonanywhere is saved on an SQL database. When generating the readings on the website, the data is obtained from the SQL database. The SQL database is used to obtain the latest, maximum, and minimum sensor readings. An HTML file is used to create the format for the web page.
